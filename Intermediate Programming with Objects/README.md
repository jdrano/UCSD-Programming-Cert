Course Description:
This course will emphasize using objecte oriented analysis and design techniques
to learn the C++ programming language. Students completing the course will learn C++ syntax, how to make use of the C++ standard library, and how to design and implement custom types that extend the standard library.

Course Highlights:
Object oriented analysis and design
Program structure, functions and variables
Classes in-depth
Operator overloading
Inheritance
Exceptions and templates
Standard library string and vector
Streams
The Standard Template Library (STL)
Two projects designed to expose the student to real-world programming concerns

Course Learning Outcomes:
Understand C++ concepts
Understand the benefits of object-oriented programming
Ability to read, write and debug C++ code including use of the C++ standard library
Obtain a working knowledge of object oriented analysis and design and how it applies in C++
